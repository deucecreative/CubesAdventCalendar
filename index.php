						<h3 class="content__title">Why is a Mobile-Friendly Website Absolutely Essential?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Mobile devices have transformed the way consumers explore products and research their most important purchases.</p>
							<p>Research conducted by Nielsen, xAd, and Telmetrics suggests that nearly half of the users they surveyed rely exclusively on their mobile devices for pre-purchase research, and that 30% of smartphone users (and 25% of tablet users) have immediate needs and purchase within an hour.</p>
							<p>However, Google research has shown that 61% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site they had trouble accessing – with 40% visit a competitor's site instead.</p>
							<p>Not only can a mobile-unfriendly site negatively affect your visitors' experience, it can also harm your search engine rankings.  Earlier this year, Google rolled out an update to their algorithm that gives mobile-friendly sites a ranking boost in the search results pages.</p>
							<p>Having a mobile-friendly website is no longer just an option – it's a requirement. If your site has not been designed with mobile browsing in mind, this should without a doubt be the first thing you address in your 2017 marketing strategy.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">What Are Featured Snippets and How Could They Help My Business?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Have you ever asked Google a 'question' and noticed that the first listing in the search results is in a special format, containing the complete answer to your question (hopefully), along with a link to the site that answered it?</p>
							<p>Well, this is what Google calls a 'featured snippet', and the good news is that anyone can have a chance of providing the answer to the searcher's question – putting their site at that coveted top spot in the listings.</p>
							<p>If your site contains any 'FAQ' type content, then you would be well-advised to make sure that it is 'marked-up' with some special code tags so that Google can get a better idea of what the content is about – and with a bit of luck, feature it in its search results pages.</p>
							<p>For more information on how to implement this on your site, as well as seeing a great example of it in action, do a Google search for 'what is schema markup?'.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">Should I Consider Using Video To Market My Business?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Absolutely. If content was king in 2016, video is likely to take the crown in 2017.</p>
							<p>YouTube reports that mobile video consumption rises 100% every year, with a third of all online activity being spent watching video.</p>
							<p>You've no doubt noticed how quickly video has infiltrated Facebook, with seemingly every other item in your newsfeed being a video doing it's very best to steal your attention.</p>
							<p>Good quality video no longer has to cost the earth – most of us carry around a high-definition video camera in our pockets that is more than capable of producing short bite-sized pieces of content that can be quickly and easily shared across your social media channels and in your email marketing.</p>
							<p>In fact, video in email can lead to a 200-300% increase in click-through rates, and including video on a landing page can increase conversion by 80%.</p>
							<p>Why not think about how you could utilise video in your online marketing? Maybe a demo of your latest product, or a walk-through of your showroom? Or maybe just something fun to show the personal side of your company.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">Do Reviews Matter?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>If you're looking to increase leads, a crucial first step would be to start earning more online customer reviews for your business.</p>
							<p>The majority of people begin their buying journey with a Google search. They scan the results looking for a reason to click. As simple as it sounds, if your company has more reviews than your competitors, there’s a good chance you’ll be the one that they are drawn to first.</p>
							<p>Reviews are about more than just commanding attention in search. Good customer reviews boost confidence in your brand. When a real person backs up the claims you’ve made on your website about your amazing service, it has a much bigger impact then when you say it yourself.</p>
							<p>By gaining a steady flow of online customer reviews about your business, you’ll be increasing Google’s confidence in your brand too, which will naturally lead to a positive increase to your rankings.</p>
							<p>So online reviews really do matter, and play a critical role in a buyer's decision-making process and willingness to buy.</p>
							<p>Start earning reviews by asking a handful of your customers to give your business some feedback via your Google 'My Business' page, Facebook page, or Yelp page – and further increase your chances of turning those browsers into buyers.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">Why is Site Speed Important?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Site speed, or more accurately, page load time, is a critical measure that can influence not only visitor behaviour, but also your search engine rankings.</p>
							<p>Website pages with long load times tend to have a higher bounce rate (the percentage of visitors who leave a site without visiting another page), and longer load times have also been shown to negatively affect conversions.</p>
							<p>Psychologically, high latency and load times between a visitor performing an action and getting a response triggers a brief period of anxiety, during which time the user is momentarily left in the dark — powerless and confused — caught between seams.</p>
							<p>This anxiety can quickly build up to create a poor user experience that will drive the user away from your website and leave them with a negative memory of your brand.</p>
							<p>Google also state that site speed is one of the signals they use in their search ranking algorithm, meaning that if your site is consistently slow to load you will be penalised in the search results.</p>
							<p>According to a recent study from Microsoft, people now generally lose concentration after eight seconds, highlighting the affects of an increasingly digitalized lifestyle on the brain.</p>
							<p>With human attention spans supposedly now shorter than those of goldfish, you need to be doing all you can to keep your visitors engaged and on your site – else risk losing them to a competitor.</p>

					<div class="content__block">
						<h3 class="content__title">What is a call-to-action and how will it benefit my business?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>You created your website with a specific goal in mind. Maybe to generate more enquiries, increase sales or entice more visitors to your shop. Whatever your ambition, if your site lacks a strong call-to-action, you'll have little luck in achieving that goal.</p>
							<p>In web terms, a call-to-action, or CTA, is most often a stand-out message accompanied by a button that prompts the visitor to do something depending on their place in the decision making process.</p>
							<p>Here's a few examples. A transitional CTA for visitors that are undecided might be 'Join Our Newsletter' or 'Download Our Guide'. A direct CTA, for committed customers, would be 'Sign Up Now', 'Buy Now' or 'Get Started'.</p>
							<p>If your CTA is cluttered within a page, it will only lead to confusion. Provide space and clarity.</p>
							<p>With so many messages fighting for attention, don't make your customers work hard – clearly direct them and get better results.</p>
							<p>So in true CTA fashion, if you like our tips so far, follow us on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">How important is website security?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Just like insurance, the importance of website security is something that's often undervalued until the worst happens.</p>
							<p>No doubt you've heard increasing reports recently of high-profile sites getting hacked and customer data being stolen – yet it still seems to be considered as one of those 'it won't happen to me' type scenarios.</p>
							<p>Granted, you might not feel like anyone would have a reason to hack your site. Maybe your site doesn't store any customer data, so you don't feel it would be target. But the majority of sites that are attacked on a daiy basis are done simply to demonstrate the hackers ability or to promote a political message. They often won't target a specific site, preferring instead to just scan the 'net for insecure hosting servers – and then break in once they find one.</p>
							<p>Imagine if one of your customers arrived on your site one day to be greeted by a blank screen with a garbled message about the site having been 'H4x0r3D by v3N0M'. It probably wouldn't leave them with the warm fuzzy feeling that you'd like them to have whenever they interact with your brand.</p>
							<p>Believe it or not, we've seen this happen on more than one occasion over the years – usually to sites hosted on low-budget shared hosting servers – so it pays dividends to use a good quality managed hosting service that takes security seriously.</p>
							<p>Another method that hackers often use to gain access to websites is through security 'holes' in unpatched website code. Always make sure that your CMS and plugins are kept up-to-date with the latest versions in order to minimise this risk.</p>
							<p>Improving site security might not seem like a marketing tip – but the consequences of not doing it could severely damage your brand, not to mention leaving your site offline unable to earn you any business.</p>
