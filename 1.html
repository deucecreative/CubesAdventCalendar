					<h2>Get more e-commerce sales this Christmas</h2>
					<p>Some e-commerce business owners assume that Christmas guarantees more sales, thus higher revenue for their business. For many, this may be true – but is your website optimised to make the most of this seasonal gold mine?</p>
					<p>Optimising your site will ensure that the sure-fire ways for getting more sales have maximum impact. So, what do we mean by this?</p>
					<h3>1.  Indulge in the festivity</h3>
					<p>The build-up to Christmas seems to start earlier every year, so your customers will already be well-aware of the approaching festivities. Although Christmas can seem a long way off for many people, it’s important to plant the seed in your customers’ minds as early as possible to prepare for the big event. It seems that it’s never too soon to plan for Christmas, but don’t worry if you’re just making a start – there’s still plenty of time to show your Christmas spirit.</p>
					<p>Add subtle Christmas decorations to your logo or website theme at the beginning of December to get your customers in the Christmas mood, and consider adding a slogan to your site. You may not have Coca Cola’s advertising budget, but a few words about the holiday ahead could add Christmas cheer to your customers’ shopping experience and make them more inclined to buy.</p>

					<h3>2.  Promote your service offerings</h3>
					<p>Are you offering any special services over the Christmas period? If so, spell them out to your customers.</p>
					<p>You could offer an extended Christmas returns guarantee. This reduces the risk of purchasing online, especially if you're buying an item of clothing for a member of the family and aren't sure if it'll be the right size.</p>
					<p>You could also have a ‘Price Match Guarantee’ or ‘Free Shipping on Orders over £XX’ to promote the service you are offering and to get ahead of the competition.</p>

					<h3>3.  Build and utilise your mailing list</h3>
					<p>Now is the time to take advantage of your email marketing strategy! The British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA) estimates that 21% of retail sales take place online. Gather information from your customers to help you to know why they shop with you at Christmas and what you could improve next year.</p>
					<p>Data can be gathered alongside sending out promotions and adverts to your existing mailing list. This will increase the visibility of your brand and remind your customers how they can avoid the stress of the Christmas crowds by shopping online.</p>
					<h3>4.  Offer incentives</h3>
					<p>Show your customers how much you value their visit to your online store. Whether they purchase something or not, make it clear that they are welcome. By offering all of your customers ‘Christmas Deals’ or ‘Christmas Best Sellers’ pages, they will feel that Christmas shopping in your store is a special, exclusive experience.</p>
					<p>Reward customers who purchase with an incentive to return to your online store in the New Year. Offer them a discount via a code that they enter before payment. A discount code is not only excellent service for your existing customers, but can attract new customers to return, and enable you to clear old stock, making room for new lines.</p>

					<h3>5.  Reassure shoppers with secure shopping</h3>
					<p>Reassuring shoppers that your e-commerce site is secure is a vital conversion booster. Having poor security measures on your site is equivalent to asking your customers to walk down an unlit alley way. They may not get mugged, but there is a high risk of them doing so.</p>
					<p>It’s essential that you present your site as a safe and secure shopping platform for your customers. You can use images to promote that your site is verified or protected by a third party – popular online security stamps include Norton, McAfee and Verified by VISA. Your customers will feel more at ease with security stamps that they recognise.</p>
