						<h3 class="content__title">Why is a Mobile-Friendly Website Absolutely Essential?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Mobile devices have transformed the way consumers explore products and research their most important purchases.</p>
							<p>Research conducted by Nielsen, xAd, and Telmetrics suggests that nearly half of the users they surveyed rely exclusively on their mobile devices for pre-purchase research, and that 30% of smartphone users (and 25% of tablet users) have immediate needs and purchase within an hour.</p>
							<p>However, Google research has shown that 61% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site they had trouble accessing – with 40% visit a competitor's site instead.</p>
							<p>Not only can a mobile-unfriendly site negatively affect your visitors' experience, it can also harm your search engine rankings.  Earlier this year, Google rolled out an update to their algorithm that gives mobile-friendly sites a ranking boost in the search results pages.</p>
							<p>Having a mobile-friendly website is no longer just an option – it's a requirement. If your site has not been designed with mobile browsing in mind, this should without a doubt be the first thing you address in your 2017 marketing strategy.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">What Are Featured Snippets and How Could They Help My Business?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Have you ever asked Google a 'question' and noticed that the first listing in the search results is in a special format, containing the complete answer to your question (hopefully), along with a link to the site that answered it?</p>
							<p>Well, this is what Google calls a 'featured snippet', and the good news is that anyone can have a chance of providing the answer to the searcher's question – putting their site at that coveted top spot in the listings.</p>
							<p>If your site contains any 'FAQ' type content, then you would be well-advised to make sure that it is 'marked-up' with some special code tags so that Google can get a better idea of what the content is about – and with a bit of luck, feature it in its search results pages.</p>
							<p>For more information on how to implement this on your site, as well as seeing a great example of it in action, do a Google search for 'what is schema markup?'.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">Should I Consider Using Video To Market My Business?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Absolutely. If content was king in 2016, video is likely to take the crown in 2017.</p>
							<p>YouTube reports that mobile video consumption rises 100% every year, with a third of all online activity being spent watching video.</p>
							<p>You've no doubt noticed how quickly video has infiltrated Facebook, with seemingly every other item in your newsfeed being a video doing it's very best to steal your attention.</p>
							<p>Good quality video no longer has to cost the earth – most of us carry around a high-definition video camera in our pockets that is more than capable of producing short bite-sized pieces of content that can be quickly and easily shared across your social media channels and in your email marketing.</p>
							<p>In fact, video in email can lead to a 200-300% increase in click-through rates, and including video on a landing page can increase conversion by 80%.</p>
							<p>Why not think about how you could utilise video in your online marketing? Maybe a demo of your latest product, or a walk-through of your showroom? Or maybe just something fun to show the personal side of your company.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">Do Reviews Matter?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>If you're looking to increase leads, a crucial first step would be to start earning more online customer reviews for your business.</p>
							<p>The majority of people begin their buying journey with a Google search. They scan the results looking for a reason to click. As simple as it sounds, if your company has more reviews than your competitors, there's a good chance you'll be the one that they are drawn to first.</p>
							<p>Reviews are about more than just commanding attention in search. Good customer reviews boost confidence in your brand. When a real person backs up the claims you've made on your website about your amazing service, it has a much bigger impact then when you say it yourself.</p>
							<p>By gaining a steady flow of online customer reviews about your business, you'll be increasing Google's confidence in your brand too, which will naturally lead to a positive increase to your rankings.</p>
							<p>So online reviews really do matter, and play a critical role in a buyer's decision-making process and willingness to buy.</p>
							<p>Start earning reviews by asking a handful of your customers to give your business some feedback via your Google 'My Business' page, Facebook page, or Yelp page – and further increase your chances of turning those browsers into buyers.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">Why is Site Speed Important?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Site speed, or more accurately, page load time, is a critical measure that can influence not only visitor behaviour, but also your search engine rankings.</p>
							<p>Website pages with long load times tend to have a higher bounce rate (the percentage of visitors who leave a site without visiting another page), and longer load times have also been shown to negatively affect conversions.</p>
							<p>Psychologically, high latency and load times between a visitor performing an action and getting a response triggers a brief period of anxiety, during which time the user is momentarily left in the dark — powerless and confused — caught between seams.</p>
							<p>This anxiety can quickly build up to create a poor user experience that will drive the user away from your website and leave them with a negative memory of your brand.</p>
							<p>Google also state that site speed is one of the signals they use in their search ranking algorithm, meaning that if your site is consistently slow to load you will be penalised in the search results.</p>
							<p>According to a recent study from Microsoft, people now generally lose concentration after eight seconds, highlighting the affects of an increasingly digitalized lifestyle on the brain.</p>
							<p>With human attention spans supposedly now shorter than those of goldfish, you need to be doing all you can to keep your visitors engaged and on your site – else risk losing them to a competitor.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">What Is a Call-to-Action and How Will It Benefit My Business?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>You created your website with a specific goal in mind. Maybe to generate more enquiries, increase sales or entice more visitors to your shop. Whatever your ambition, if your site lacks a strong call-to-action, you'll have little luck in achieving that goal.</p>
							<p>In web terms, a call-to-action, or CTA, is most often a stand-out message accompanied by a button that prompts the visitor to do something depending on their place in the decision making process.</p>
							<p>Here's a few examples. A transitional CTA for visitors that are undecided might be 'Join Our Newsletter' or 'Download Our Guide'. A direct CTA, for committed customers, would be 'Sign Up Now', 'Buy Now' or 'Get Started'.</p>
							<p>If your CTA is cluttered within a page, it will only lead to confusion. Provide space and clarity.</p>
							<p>With so many messages fighting for attention, don't make your customers work hard – clearly direct them and get better results.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">How Important Is Website Security?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Just like insurance, the importance of website security is something that's often undervalued until the worst happens.</p>
							<p>No doubt you've heard increasing reports recently of high-profile sites getting hacked and customer data being stolen – yet it still seems to be considered as one of those 'it won't happen to me' type scenarios.</p>
							<p>Granted, you might not feel like anyone would have a reason to hack your site. Maybe your site doesn't store any customer data, so you don't feel it would be a target. But the majority of sites that are attacked on a daily basis are done simply to demonstrate the hackers ability or to promote a political message. They often won't target a specific site, preferring instead to just scan the 'net for insecure hosting servers – and then break in once they find one.</p>
							<p>Imagine if one of your customers arrived on your site one day to be greeted by a blank screen with a garbled message about the site having been 'H4x0r3D by v3N0M'. It probably wouldn't leave them with the warm fuzzy feeling that you'd like them to have whenever they interact with your brand.</p>
							<p>Believe it or not, we've seen this happen on more than one occasion over the years – usually to sites hosted on low-budget shared hosting servers – so it pays dividends to use a good quality managed hosting service that takes security seriously.</p>
							<p>Another method that hackers often use to gain access to websites is through security 'holes' in unpatched website code. Always make sure that your CMS and plugins are kept up-to-date with the latest versions in order to minimise this risk.</p>
							<p>Improving site security might not seem like a marketing tip – but the consequences of not doing it could severely damage your brand, not to mention leaving your site offline unable to earn you any business.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">What Are Web Analytics and Why Are They Important?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Web analytics allow you to measure and review how your visitors arrive on your site, and what they do once there. These metrics allow you to gain valuable insights into who your visitors are and how well your website is performing, helping you determine how best to maximise traffic and conversions.</p>
							<p>Knowing where your visitors are coming from is essential to know which of your marketing channels are working well, as well as identify potential new opportunities. And knowing how they interact with your site helps you optimise the user experience to keep them engaged for longer and turn them into customers.</p>
							<p>Analytics can help you track the performance of your social media and PPC advertising campaigns, or see what percentage of your users are browsing on mobile devices or using a specific browser.</p>
							<p>It might sound complex, but web analytics are easy to implement and use. We're fans of both Google Analytics and Hotjar, as they are simple to understand, and together provide a goldmine of information on visitor behaviour.</p>
							<p>Without analytics, you won't have any idea why your website isn't performing, nor will you have anything to benchmark any improvements against. If your site doesn't have any analytics set up, make this the first thing you do in 2017 and start collecting that valuable data.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">What Is Conversion Rate Optimisation and How Will It Help Increase Business?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>No matter how well-designed you think your site is, the chances are that there is room for improvement. If you're spending money on paid advertising or SEO to generate traffic to your site, then you want to be squeezing the most value out of it.</p>
							<p>Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO) is the process of refining your sites user experience with the primary objective of increasing the percentage of visitors that complete a particular goal.</p>
							<p>Depending on the nature of your site, these goals might include getting your visitor to complete a checkout process, subscribe to your newsletter, download a brochure, fill in an enquiry form – or even pick up the phone (yes, calls can be tracked too).</p>
							<p>Ultimately, the aim of CRO is to convert more visitors into customers – so by making the conversion process easier (or more appealing) for your visitors, more of them will convert and you'll get a better return on your investment.</p>
							<p>In order to make informed decisions as to what changes could be made to improve your conversion rates, it's essential to gather real-world data so that you can understand who your visitors are and how they are interacting with your site. This will help you identify potential problem areas, or missed opportunities.</p>
							<p>This data can be obtained through a variety of methods such as web analytics (which pages are popular or unpopular), heatmapping (identifying which areas of your site get the most clicks), user testing (asking test subjects to perform a particular task and give you feedback on how easy they found it), and exit surveys (i.e. asking your visitors why they are about to leave your site).</p>
							<p>Armed with this information, you can make informed decisions as to what you should try changing in order to increase your conversion rates, and generate more business from your website.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">How Can I Generate More Enquiries Without More Traffic?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Did you know that around 75% of your website visitors will visit once and never come back? That's a lot of missed conversion opportunities! The first step in keeping them coming back is to identify why they left in the first place. Is your website taking too long to load? Does it have too many adverts or pop-ups? Is your navigation clunky and difficult to use? Any sort of bad experience is enough to leave people running for the door.</p>
							<p>When someone reaches your site, is it clear what they should be doing? It's important your website has a strong call-to-action. This is often a stand-out message accompanied by a button that prompts the visitor to do something. Without a strong CTA, visitors might get confused with your website, leading them to click off. And if they were confused on their first visit, why would they return?</p>
							<p>If you haven't already, implement customer feedback into your website and marketing channels. Reviews and testimonials play a critical role in a buyer's decision-making process and willingness to buy. Building trust is vital in a digital landscape, and good customer reviews help boost confidence in your brand.</p>
							<p>Finally, make sure you regularly update your website and social media pages. Vistors are unlikely to be inclined to return if there's nothing new to see or do. Make regular contact too – personalised email marketing and targeted ads are likely to put you in the forefront of people's mind when looking for your product or service.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">What Is a Unique Value Proposition and Why Is It Important?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>A Unique Value Proposition, or UVP, is a simple statement that succinctly describes what you offer, how it will benefit your customer, and ideally what makes it better than your competitors' offerings. You want to be as specific as possible here without divulging into unnecessary detail.</p>
							<p>An great example is "Uber is the smartest way to get around. One tap and a car comes directly to you. Your driver knows exactly where to go. And payment is completely cashless." Without explicitly saying so, Uber highlights everything that is bad about traditional taxi services and points out how its service is superior.</p>
							<p>With so much choice available, especially online, a UVP is important to help encourage people to buy from you instead of from someone else. And with ever-decreasing attention spans, you have around ten seconds to get across to your website visitors what you are offering and why they should buy it from you. If they don't feel their needs have been addressed, they will be gone in a click, searching elsewhere instead.</p>
							<p>Don't confuse a UVP with a strapline. A strapline is a brief sentence to capture your company and its values. Although similar, a UVP is usually a bit more specific to describe what makes your business different.</p>
							<p>Why not take some time over Christmas to sit down with a pen and paper, and write down the reasons why you believe that your company is the best choice for your customers. This should help you come up with an engaging UVP that totally sums up your business.</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">Why Is Social Media Important To My Business?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Maintaining a proactive presence on social media can have a multitude of benefits for your business. You can obtain customer insights and deliver better customer service, whilst increasing the reputation and trust in your brand. It's also great for promoting content and driving web traffic to your site. It can be quite daunting to begin with, but you can start up and maintain a few accounts fairly easily.</p>
							<p>Research and follow Twitter/Facebook business users that could be beneficial to your business, and build a network of interesting and useful connections to engage with. Social media should be about connecting with real people. At most, 10% of tweets should be automated – the rest should be manual. Automating everything doesn't build relationships, and is the equivalent of handing out a hundred business cards in five minutes.</p>
							<p>You should be posting out interesting content that represents the real life personality of your company. You should aim to post on Twitter two or three times a day, and on Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram most days. Don't worry if you miss a post in your schedule – it's much more important to post something meaningful rather than any old rubbish just to get a tweet or post out.</p>
							<p>It's also good to reply to other people's tweets or comment on their posts, as this engagement demonstrates that you value their output, and it can often lead to some valuable conversations.</p>
							<p>If your business isn't active on social media, make it a priority for 2017 and you should start to see the benefits over the coming year.</p>

						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Blogging is a great way of generating new leads. A blog post might be the only page a visitor sees so if your website has a specific goal, put it on your blog post pages. Think about how many posts your blog has. Hopefully quite a few. If they all have a clear call-to-atcion, there’s more chance it will get seen with the more posts you publish.</p>
							<p>Every post is another page filled with keywords, showing Google your site is regularly updated therefore boosting your SEO. We use Yoast for SEO on our WordPress sites, a handy tool to help ensure our post content is optimised for maximum search engine visibility. Get Yoast for WordPress here: <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="blank">yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/</a></p>
							<p>An up-to-date blog will also keep visitors coming back as it gives them a reason to return regularly. And a regular visitor are more likely to convert into a paying customer. Blogging is also a non-intrusive way to demonstrate your knowledge and represent yourself as an industry leader which will position you highly in peoples minds when making the choice to buy products or services. </p>
							<p>Advertise your blog and publish on other platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn and Medium. Blogging is a great way of generating shareable, engaging content for social media and diverting people to your website. For popular blog posts, market them through Facebook ads and Adwords to bring in new site visitors and make sure you always use Facebook’s tracking pixel on blog posts to build up a network of Facebook accounts to target advertisements to. </p>
							<p>The benefits of having an up-to-date blog are huge so why not make 2017 your year of blogging and find out what more a blog can help bring to your site?</p>

						<h3 class="content__title">How can I increase my website’s visibility in search engine results?</h3>
						<div class="content__description">
							<p>Optimising your website to appear higher or more frequent in search engine result pages is known as SEO (Search Engine Optimisation). Increasing SEO can start with just a few small tweaks to your website. </p>
							<p>Check content is correct and regularly updated (blogs are great for this) to remind Google and other search engines to check for new content. Use relevant keywords in your page content, titles and links and include a dynamic sitemap that updates when your site does. This will help search engines read your site easier and quicker.</p>
							<p>Search engines might read your content but they don’t know what it means or the context it’s in. Using Schema Markup code helps them to understand what the information is and helps return better informative search results to users. Visit <a href="http://schema.org/" target="blank">schema.org</a> to help implement Schema Markup code.</p>
							<p>Optimise your images too with alt and title tags. Search engines can’t read images but using alt and title tags helps overcome this. Where possible, you should GEO locate images to be associated with your business location.</p>
							<p>There are two absolute musts for SEO in 2017 as Google recently made changes to it’s search algorithm. We witnessed Mobilegeddon which favours mobile friendly sites. If your website isn’t optimised for mobile, make this your number one priority for the beginning of next year. More recently announced is Google’s plan for a more secure web. The newest Chrome browser will mark sites without an SSL certificate as insecure and ranking them down search results pages. An SSL certificate encrypts sensitive data like passwords and card details and is now an absolute must for next year. If you are ensure about SSL, contact your hosting provider. </p>
